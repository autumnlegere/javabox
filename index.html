        <h1>Watch That Box!</h1>
        <p>
            This is one of the first projects I ever worked on. 
            The html code was provided, but none of the buttons performed any function.
            <br/> I wrote the javascript file and linked it to the html so now each button causes a change in the box.
            Enjoy!
